ActsAsVerifiable
================

This plugin lets you create entities with a verification status. Once an entity is modified,
the status of the entity is set to 'Unverified'. The plugin lets you check the status of the
entity and also lets you set it to 'Verified'.

The plugin uses polymorphic association and hence can be used with any model without
any change required in the model itself.

Plugin needs to have a VerificationStatus model to function properly.


Example
=======

You only need to call 'acts_as_verifiable' in the model class

class SomeClass < ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_verifiable
end

To check the status of the entity:
@entity.is_verified?

To set as verified:
@entity.set_as_verified
